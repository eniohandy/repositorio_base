A great choice! Here's a simple and delicious recipe for sautÃ©ed mushrooms that pairs well with many dishes:

**Garlic Butter Mushrooms**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup fresh mushrooms (button, cremini, or shiitake), sliced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

Instructions:

1. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown, about 3-4 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.

This recipe is great as a side dish, or use it as a topping for:

* Steak or roasted meats
* Pasta or risotto
* Pizza or garlic bread
* Omelets or scrambled eggs

You can also customize the recipe by adding other aromatics like onions, thyme, or lemon juice to the mushrooms. Enjoy!

You can use the `rename` command, also known as `prename`, which is part of the Perl package. Here's an example:

Assuming you have files named `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, ..., `filen.txt` in a directory and you want to rename them to `001_file1.txt`, `002_file2.txt`, ..., `nnn_filenn.txt` respectively.

```bash
rename -n 's//$i.'_ &' *.*
```

Here, the `rename` command is used with the `-n` option (dry run), which means it will only show you what changes would be made without actually renaming the files. The pattern `s//` is a simple substitution where everything on the left side of the `/` is replaced by the expression on the right side. `$i.'_ &'` expands to the current filename with the numeric prefix appended.

For example, if your directory contains `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`, running this command would output:

```bash
rename file1.txt -> 001_file1.txt
rename file2.txt -> 002_file2.txt
rename file3.txt -> 003_file3.txt
```

If you're satisfied with the proposed changes, simply remove the `-n` option to apply them.

Let's count the apples step by step!

You have 2 apples.

Your friend has 2 apples more than you, which means they have:

2 (your apples) + 2 = 4 apples

So, your friend has 4 apples.

To find out how many apples we have in total, let's add together your apples and your friend's apples:

You: 2 apples
Friend: 4 apples
Total: 2 + 4 = 6 apples

Therefore, we have a total of 6 apples.
